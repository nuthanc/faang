### Dynamic Programming

* Check **Graph's README** for Greedy and Dynamic Topics

### How to Recognize it's a Dynamic Programming Problem

* Most of the times, Optimization questions(MinMax) are DP
  * Among all possible solutions, you picking the best one
* Not all problems that have DP as a potential solution require DP as a solution
* With Optimization questions,
  * we need to generate all of the possible paths that we can take
  * Pick the one with the minimum value(w.r.t 26th question)
* Dynamic Programming has its basis in Recursion
  * basecases

### Question

* Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a given target

### Steps before solving

1.Verify the constraints
  * Are all the numbers positive or can there be negatives?
    * Only positives
  * Are there duplicate numbers in the array?
    * No duplicates
  * Will there always be a solution available(**Good Question**)?
    * No
    * 25 -> [1,3,7,9,2], [], [5]
    * The above are Edge cases
  * What do we return if there's no solution?
    * Return null
  * Can there be multiple pairs that add up to the target?
    * No, only 1 pair

2.Write out some test cases
  * Capture all of the edge cases discussed
  * 1st test case is our **best case**
    * [1,3,7,9,2] t=11
      * This satisfies all the above constraints
  * Next test case **no solution**
    * [1,2,3,4,5] t=25
    * [] t=5
    * [5] t=8
    * [5] t=5 (**Notice this should return null**)
    * [1,6] t=7 (**Guaranteed solution**)

3.Figure out a solution without code
  * Consider our best case example [1,3,7,9,2]
  * Add indices on top while writing down(As indices are the results)
  * Assign it to nums like nums = [1,3,7,9,2]
  * Two pointers p1 and p2
    * 1 fixed and other scan for all the numbers
  * Number to find = Target - nums[p1]

4.Then code the solution
  * First for the best case

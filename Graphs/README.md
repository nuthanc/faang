### Graphs

* Collection of nodes(vertex) and connections(edges)
* Nodes can have any number of connections
* Possibilities of Cycle(Circular connection)
* Undirected and Directed
* Unweighted(No weight to edges) and Weighted
* Unconnected Graph(Entirety of all nodes not connected as one Structure)
* All Trees are Graphs, but not all Graphs are Trees
* Binary Tree as a Directed Graph
* 2D arrays also represent Graph

### Representation of Graphs

* Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix

### Adjacency List

![al](../img/al.png)
![al2](../img/al2.png)
* List or Object 
* List where Index value corresponds to nodes
* Nodes attached as value to the index

### Adjacency Matrix

![am](../img/am.png)

### BFS

### DFS
